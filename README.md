# Singularity
Singularity is a ioc container that focuses on the following things
- Very high performance. Any runtime costs are reduced as much as possible. This makes it feasible to use singularity in applications where performance matters such as games. Performance in Singularity is measured in nanoseconds as opposed to microseconds.
- No magic. Singularity has been designed in such a way that it won't hide too much from you. For instance `Dispose` wont be automagically called but instead you can configure Singularity to do so through the `OnDeath` method.
